Formally speaking, Sponsorship is a form of affinity marketing that provides certain rights and benefits to the buyer or “sponsor” which is usually in conjunction with a property, venue, personality, or event. It touts a broad spectrum of benefits for the sponsors such as helping to develop closer and better relationships with customers, brand visibility, community goodwill, showcasing opportunities of services and products etc. On the other hand, it also benefits the organizers as the sponsors provide a financial partnership for the smooth conduction of events and also attracts a large pool of audiences and their participation which leads the event into success. The entire procedure of Sponsorship is taken care of by the Sponsorship Co-Ordinators.

                                    Marketing is an ongoing communication exchange with customers in a way that educates, informs and builds a relationship over time.  With trust, a community builds organically around products and services and those customers become as excited about the products as you are . Marketing is a really great way to identify what grabs people's attention and gets them excited about your brand. It involves them in the process, and yeah, the best part, builds great relationships in the process. 
                                    For a fest to be successful there should be an urge of excitement and trust in the audience. Hereby this goal is achieved by a strong marketing team.
